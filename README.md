# Introduction 

**Welcome to my repository!**


If you're looking for a comprehensive roadmap to specialize in full stack development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), you've come to the right place. This roadmap has been carefully chosen, organizing the best resources available to help you learn and master full stack development with a focus on MERN.

The selected resources in this roadmap are designed to provide a hands-on learning experience. You will have the opportunity to learn by doing, as the courses include exercises, challenges, and guided projects that facilitate easy learning and practical application.

 

**By the end of the roadmap you will be able to build full stack application from scratch! ðŸš€**

## How it works? 
This roadmap is based on what I've learned on Twitter to help you learn coding quickly and effectively. It follows a simple three-step process:

1. **Crash Course:** Start with a concise and focused course that covers the fundamentals This will provide you with a solid foundation of the concepts.

2. **Guided Project:** After completing the crash course, engage in a guided project where you follow step-by-step instructions to create a projects or build an application. 

3. **Personal Project:** Once you've completed the guided project, it's time to take on a personal project of your own. This project serves two purposes: solidifying your understanding of the concepts learned and giving you the freedom to apply your creativity.
