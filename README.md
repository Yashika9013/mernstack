# Introduction 

**Welcome to my repository!**


This repository contains a roadmap to becoming a skilled full stack developer who was  specializes in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) technology stack. The roadmap is organized into a series of exercises, challenges, and projects that will help you learn the MERN stack.

The roadmap provides a variety of resources to help you learn the MERN stack, including YouTube videos, courses, and documentation.


The exercises, challenges, and projects are all well-documented, and they provide clear instructions on how to complete them. This roadmap covers everything from fundamental concepts to advanced topics, as well as the tools and deployment techniques commonly used by developers. 

By the end of the roadmap you will be able to build full stack application from scratch!

**Happy coding and may this repository be a valuable asset in your path to success! ðŸš€**

## How it works? 
This roadmap is based on what I've learned on Twitter to help you learn coding quickly and effectively. It follows a simple three-step process:

1. **Crash Course:** Start with a concise and focused course that covers the fundamentals This will provide you with a solid foundation of the concepts.

2. **Guided Project:** After completing the crash course, engage in a guided project where you follow step-by-step instructions to create a projects or build an application. 

3. **Personal Project:** Once you've completed the guided project, it's time to take on a personal project of your own. This project serves two purposes: solidifying your understanding of the concepts learned and giving you the freedom to apply your creativity.

## **Capstone**
In this capstone project, you'll have the opportunity to build a full-stack application and apply all the knowledge and skills you've acquired throughout the crash courses and guided from this roadmap. It serves as a culmination of your learning journey, allowing you to demonstrate your proficiency in developing complete web applications. 

I don't have yet any idea for a capstone project, so feel free to make your own capstone.

## **Conclusion**
In conclusion, this roadmap offers a comprehensive path to becoming a specialized full stack developer, with a focus on MERN stack. It includes numerous exercises, challenges, and real-world projects to enhance your skills. By following this roadmap, you will progressively build your proficiency, culminating in the development of your own capstone full stack application. I hope you find this roadmap enjoyable and valuable in your journey. 

#### **Note:**
```
Each course or section like front end, back end, etc. must have a crash course or guided project, but if is not mentioned or included, it implies that the listed course already offers a comprehensive crash course as well as a guided project. Therefore, no additional content or value has been added by including such projects.
